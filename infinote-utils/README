To Whom It May Concern:

Your annoying, boring, leadership-less LUPIN SysArch
has just released v0.1 of package "gobby_utils"

You can download the sources and the documentation from
http://lupin05.venaria.marelli.it/svnrepos/lupin/platforms/LUPIN/code/trunk/misc/admin_scripts/gobby_utils/

Please help improve the tool, which is distributed under the GPLv2 license -
as you can guess by scanning the codebase with FOSSology or other
more expensive tools such as
$ cat LICENSE
$ dd if=LICENSE of=/dev/console

As usual, if there is anything missing or broken YOU may fix it, NOT me (that is Open Source, isnâ€™t it?)

This tool may be used to keep a mirror of the gobby@lupin13 data under
http://lupin05.venaria.marelli.it/svnrepos/lupin/mirrors/lupin13.venaria.marelli.it/infinoted/
	
(NOTE: Just in case that https://trace3.windriver.com/?Lupin1.1,I0037 is not closing ASAP...)

Cordiali Saluti - Best Regards
